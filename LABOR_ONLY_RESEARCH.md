# Labor-Only Moving Services Research

## Key Insight: Single Location Jobs

Labor-only services work at ONE location only:
- **Load Only**: Pack customer's truck at origin (2-10 hours depending on size)
- **Unload Only**: Unpack customer's truck at destination (25-33% FASTER than loading)
- **In-House**: Move items within same location

**NO driving between locations** - this makes jobs much faster!

## Loading vs Unloading: The Critical Difference

### Loading (Tetris Phase) - SLOWER
- Strategic 3D puzzle solving
- Weight distribution critical
- Every item placement affects next decision
- Strapping, wrapping, securing
- Baseline time

### Unloading (Grab & Go) - FASTER
- Puzzle already solved
- Just grab and place in rooms
- Less decision-making
- **25-33% faster than loading** (60-75% of load time)

## Time Estimates by Home Size

### LOAD ONLY (Baseline)
| Home Size | Crew | Loading Time |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| Studio | 2 | 2-3 hours |
| 1 Bedroom | 2 | 2-4 hours |
| 2 Bedroom | 2-3 | 3-6 hours |
| 3 Bedroom | 2-3 | 5-8 hours |
| 4+ Bedroom | 3-4 | 6-10+ hours |

### UNLOAD ONLY (Faster!)
| Home Size | Crew | Unloading Time | Speed vs Load |
|-----------|------|----------------|---------------|
| Studio | 2 | 1.5-2.5 hours | 25-33% faster |
| 1 Bedroom | 2 | 1.5-3 hours | 25-33% faster |
| 2 Bedroom | 2-3 | 2-4.5 hours | 25-33% faster |
| 3 Bedroom | 2-3 | 3.5-6 hours | 25-30% faster |
| 4+ Bedroom | 3-4 | 4.5-8 hours | 25-30% faster |

## Adjustment Factors

### Stairs: +30-60 minutes per flight
### Long carry (100+ feet): +30-60 minutes
### Specialty items: +30 minutes each
### Preparation level: +25-50% if not ready

## Industry Standards

- **Minimum**: 2-3 hours
- **Rates**: $25-50 per mover per hour
- **Crew size**: 2 movers minimum for safety

## The Single Location Advantage

Labor-only is 20-30% faster than full-service because:
- No truck driving time
- No coordination between locations
- Pure focus on physical labor
- No vehicle management
