# Moving Calculator Research Findings

## Executive Summary
Moving companies use systematic formulas combining home size, crew size, and adjustment factors to calculate labor hours. Industry operates on **person-hour** methodology where total labor = movers × hours.

## Key Formulas

### Total Hours Formula
```
Total Hours = Base Hours + Drive Time + Stairs + Distance + Specialty Items
```

### Base Hours by Home Size (Industry Consensus)

| Home Type | Recommended Movers | Estimated Hours | Move Type Multiplier |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Studio | 2 | 2-3 | Load: 1.0x, Unload: 0.75x, Both: 1.75x |
| 1 Bedroom | 2 | 2-4 | Load: 1.0x, Unload: 0.75x, Both: 1.75x |
| 2 Bedroom | 2-3 | 3-6 | Load: 1.0x, Unload: 0.75x, Both: 1.75x |
| 3 Bedroom | 3-4 | 5-8 | Load: 1.0x, Unload: 0.75x, Both: 1.75x |
| 4+ Bedroom | 4-5 | 8-12+ | Load: 1.0x, Unload: 0.75x, Both: 1.75x |

## Adjustment Factors

### Stairs/Floors
- Ground floor with elevator: +0 hours
- One flight of stairs: +0.5 to 1 hour
- Two flights: +1 hour (minimum 3 movers)
- Each additional flight: +0.5-1 hour

### Drive Distance
- Under 10 miles: Included in base
- 10-40 miles: +0.5 hours
- 40-75 miles: +1-2 hours
- 75-100 miles: +2-3 hours

### Heavy/Specialty Items
- 1-2 items (piano, safe, etc.): +0.5 hours (minimum 3 movers)
- 3+ items: +1 hour (minimum 4 movers)

### Packing Services
- Partial packing: +1.5 hours (minimum 3 movers)
- Full packing: +2.5 hours (+1 mover to crew)

## Move Type Multipliers (Important!)

- **Load Only**: 1.0× base time
- **Unload Only**: 0.75× base time (25% faster!)
- **Load & Unload (Full Service)**: 1.75× base time
- **In-House Move**: Similar to unload (0.75-1.0x)

## Crew Size Optimization

### When to use different crew sizes:

**2 Movers:**
- Studio or 1BR apartments
- Under 800 sq ft
- Minimal stairs
- No specialty items

**3 Movers (Industry "Sweet Spot"):**
- 2-3 bedroom homes
- 1+ flights of stairs
- 1-2 heavy items
- Most common configuration

**4+ Movers:**
- 3+ bedroom homes
- Multiple flights of stairs
- 3+ specialty items
- Very large inventories

## Industry Rules of Thumb

1. **2-3 hours per bedroom** as base calculation
2. **Unloading is ~25% faster than loading**
3. **Each flight of stairs adds 1 hour**
4. **One mover per bedroom** to mitigate fatigue
5. **3 movers is the "sweet spot"** for most 2-3BR moves
